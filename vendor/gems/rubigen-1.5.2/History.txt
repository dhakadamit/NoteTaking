* Trying to remove a circular rubigen->newgem->rubigen dependency issue

== 1.5.1 2008-12-29

* Return #write_manifest which was accidently removed

* rubigen tests now pass against ruby 1.9.0 and ruby 1.9.1(prerelease 2)

== 1.3.3 2008-10-21

== 1.3.2 2008-05-19

* app_gen/bin - includes #!/usr/bin/env ruby
* added examples of file_copy_each and template_copy_each to generators

== 1.3.1 2008-04-25

* Fixed the require statements in generated tests for rails/merb generators
* Rails::Generator::Base is a valid generator superclass
* Rails generators have alternate template (based on standard NamedBase)
* test helpers define RAILS_ROOT for rails generators

== 1.3.0 2008-04-25

* component_generator: specific subclasses for rails + merb generators,
  not the generic RubiGen::Base

== 1.2.3 2008-02-22

== 1.2.2 2008-02-20

* Fixed rake post_news/email output bug ("\\n\\n")
* removed bad \" from generator banner strings
* destination_path/root have File.expand_path applied to them to ensure
  base_name gives useful term
* generate/destroy set APP_ROOT with expand_path too
  
== 1.2.0 2008-02-14

* application_generator's bin now looks for generator within local source, not
  within an install gem - so the bin/foo can be run in development without
  requiring installation.
* New collision option *i* - ignore all collisions; works like *a* which forces 
  all collisions to overwrite existing files; i skips all collisions.
* Supported test scope for install_rubigen_scripts: javascript_test

== 1.1.1 2007-11-08

* active_support is now a dependency of this gem on install (it was being used
  but wasn't a dependency)

* Promoted 'application_generator' and 'component_generator' to Rubigen
from NewGem project (they are available even if newgem not installed)
* install_rubigen_scripts default test fixed by mapping scopes to strings
* version.js uploaded to website

== 1.0.8 2007-11-03

* install_rubigen_scripts adds 'test_unit' to scopes unless a test-related scope is added
* remove examples directory because it's redundant.  See rails gem. [Winston Tsang]
* Add missing template empty_log. [Winston Tsang]
* Moved test_unit generator to test_unit scope (instead of global scope)
* generator_full_paths now returns the sources in reverse order [thx hassox]

== 1.0.7 2007-11-02

* Moved test_unit generator to test_unit scope (instead of global scope)

== 1.0.6 2007-10-18

* Templates can end with .erb (e.g. model.rb.erb) and template_copy_each will remove the .erb extension (create model.rb)

== 1.0.5 2007-10-08

* Added Jeremy Kemper to license/copyright/gem author list.

== 1.0.4 2007-09-07

* New manifest actions:
  * m.folder - copies over all files in folder into target path
* helper run_generator returns generator instance (so you can assert instance variables/methods etc)
* base_name method for generators - returns basename of destination_root, unless its trunk/tags/branches

== 1.0.3 2007-08-22

* /generators folder is automatically picked up by all component/app generators [bug fix]

== 1.0.2 2007-08-22

* Renamed rubigen_install_script -> install_rubigen_script
* install_rubigen_script is now a component generator so can be reused by other generators to create script/generate
* Added "Thanks to Jeremy Kemper" into website
* Cleaned up USAGE for test_unit
* If a generator does not have a USAGE file, then it is invisible from lists of available generators.
  This will be the mechanism for having hidden generators (e.g. install_rubigen_scripts)

== 1.0.1 2007-08-20

* Moved builtin generators into root folders, away from lib folder, to protected them
  from ri/rdocs processes (which didn't like ERb <%= %> inside Ruby files)

== 1.0.0 2007-08-17
* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release
