= TODO

* default #manifest to clone over any folders + files + apply erb to any *.erb files
* rspec examples generated for application_generator and component_generator as per newgem
* Labels for displays based on scope (common, rails, newgem), not rubygems, builtin, etc. Perhaps use one PathSource per scope.
  See RubiGen::Scripts::Base#usage_message
* Local generators (~/.rubigen) can be scoped (~/.rubigen/rails_generators)
